# Attractiveness-AI
** This was a silly project I did a couple years ago when I was starting my journey into ML. Don't take it too seriously :)

I created an AI that assigns a value to the 'beauty' of a person based on a Chicago Faces database. It's pretty inaccurate right now, but hopefully with modifications I can increase it's accuracy. DISCLAIMER: This isn't meant to be hurtful, and take it's rating with a grain of salt. Several factors influence its rating - even with the same face. I just wanted to see how an AI judges beauty and to code an image analyzing system.
